# Meet Franken-BERT!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**:waning_crescent_moon: On a dark stormy night, there were two Data Scientists who worked together in a secret lab called Zoom. With their combined passion, determination, and caffeine intake, they created a model that contained a mixture of their findings! Thus, Franken-BERT was born! HE'S ALIIIIIVE!** :zap: *Insert dramatic lightning strike and thunder sound effects here.*

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains the joint efforts and research of Austin Francis and Ashley Brooks of Labs33 in creating a most efficient BERT model to be used in the Blue Witness product for Lambda Labs.

Included are all of the ingredients that were required to give Franken-BERT life as well as how you can pick up the pieces to move forward with the Blue Witness Labs Product.

These ingredients include articles, vidoes, notes, notebooks, and picture guides. However, it is important to note that the secret ingredients (the ones that really give Franken-BERT life) are passion, determination, a curiosity for the unknown, and just a sprinkle of late nights and caffeine products.

We hope that this serves as a guide and reference for all others who will be working with Franken-BERT and that you will have as much fun as we did.

Please include and contribute any other resources and notes you use along your journey with Franken-BERT so that others may learn about the changes and upgrades made. 



**Goodluck, enjoy, and have fun!**
