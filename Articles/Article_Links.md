[This](http://mccormickml.com/2019/07/22/BERT-fine-tuning/#31-bert-tokenizer) is a great article with a more simple explanation of the ins and outs of BERT. 
([This](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pTuQhug6Dhl9XalKB0zUGf4FIdYFlpcX?usp=sharing) is the Colab notebook that goes with this article)
