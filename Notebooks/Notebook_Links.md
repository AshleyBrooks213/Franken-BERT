# These two notebooks contains data searching from ACAB.csv and Brooklyn_Center.csv files. (Located in the Files folder)

- The purpose of this was to search for tweets that were posted by News sources to find True instances of Police brutality.
- While there are True cases that have been reported from new sources in these data sets, there is still some cleaning that needs done to really parse out the True cases.
- Unfortunately, a lot of them are going to be repeats of the same case. Thus, there will not be enough data to train the model on.
- Please, keep this in mind as you continue to work on this project with Labs. 
- Data sourcing appears to be the biggest obstacle.
